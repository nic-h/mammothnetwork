# Cleanup: Dependencies and Exports Audit

This issue captures the outputs of `npx depcheck` and `npx ts-prune -p tsconfig.json` for quick reference.

## depcheck

Command: `npx depcheck --json`

Raw output:

```
{"dependencies":[],"devDependencies":[],"missing":{},"using":{"better-sqlite3":["server/db.js","scripts/db.init.js"],"dotenv":["server/index.js"],"express":["server/index.js"],"morgan":["server/index.js"],"compression":["server/index.js"],"sharp":["jobs/sync-metadata.js"]},"invalidFiles":{},"invalidDirs":{}}
```

Notes:
- PIXI has been removed; deck.gl is the single engine. If `depcheck` surfaces PIXI again, remove it.
- `sharp` is loaded dynamically in `jobs/sync-metadata.js` (optional dependency); depcheck marks it as used.

## ts-prune

Command: `npx ts-prune -p tsconfig.json`

Output:

```
No tsconfig.json found
```

We are a JS/ESM codebase at the moment; ts-prune is not applicable without TS sources and a tsconfig.

## Suggestions
- Ensure no dormant PIXI artifacts remain. We deleted `public/main.js`, `public/viewport.js`, and `public/lib/pixi.min.js`.
- Consider consolidating styles: we now have `public/client/styles/layout.css` and `public/style.css`. Some selectors in `style.css` (e.g., `.shell`, `.main-container`, older panel classes) may be dead after the new layout; safe to prune after a quick pass.
- No Next/React remnants detected (no `react`/`next` deps, no `pages/` structure).

> Generated by the cleanup task; follow-ups: prune dead CSS and re-run depcheck after any changes.
