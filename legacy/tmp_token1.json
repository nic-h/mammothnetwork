In fact, they've continued to live, unseen, in the background of human history, bearing witness to its horrors, its triumphs, and its folly. They were present at Golgotha. They were there on the grassy knoll. They've watched the toppling of tyrants and the fast-changing fortunes of empires. Quietly, mammoths observe, withholding judgment, wanting nothing other than to fit in."}}
